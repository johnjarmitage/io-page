I am a scientist working at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP). I have an interdisciplinary background working on integrating geophysics, geochemistry, and sedimentology into numerical models. I have more than 10 years of research experience since beginning my PhD at the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton. My background is diverse and can be split into three complementary research areas: (1) the formation of continent-ocean margins, (2) the long-term evolution of continental interiors, and (3) surface processes. From predicting the seismic shear wave structure beneath the East Pacific Rise to the response of alluvial architecture to change in climate, my research has focused on developing physical models to understand how complex systems have evolved, and to extract the key controlling factors on the evolution of our planet.
